                    <p>Whenever I am discouraged, among the thing that encourage me is watching anime shows. Most of the anime shows that I watch have a motivating message. Anime characters usually work hard to achieve any goals that they want. For example, Luffy <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cb/Monkey_D_Luffy.png" width="30" height="30">in One Piece wanted to be the strongest, not only because he wanted to be the King of Pirate, but also he wanted to protect all his friends. He did everything and endures all the trainings needed for him to be strongest. </p>
